      <p class="tag2-3">Indian weddings! There is no doubt that in Indian culture, weddings are the biggest event
         and happen on a very large scale. People spend most of their life savings in organizing lavish weddings of their kid(s) 
         with the most scrumptious food. Food is one of the main and very important things about Indian weddings. Tons of food is 
         prepared for the grand wedding celebrations, but does all that food get eaten? The answer to this is NO. In fact, all that food is thrown away and wasted. <br><br>
        
        Indian weddings that are famous for ages for being lavish have only one major throwback and that is FOOD WASTAGE. Sadly, this is often ignored and taken lightly. The leftover food at a wedding is a very common issue, but the main challenge that comes is to not let that food get wasted. According to several types of research, approximately 40 percent of the food prepared at a wedding venue is wasted and thrown away after the wedding ends. Indiaâ€™s estimated 10 million weddings a year contribute to food wastage. 
        <br><br>
        We all are aware that in India, starvation is one of the major causes of death. We can overcome this issue easily as our country has enough food to feed everyone, it just needs to be used properly. Countless children sleep empty stomach and are starving out there. While finalizing the wedding menu, people often forget that food prepared in such a large quantity might get wasted at the end of the event. Luckily, the commitment to give back to society is increasing nowadays and people have started thinking through till after-the-event.<br>
        . Nowadays, there are a lot of NGOs that are working to control food wastage by distributing excess food in areas where it is needed. These NGOs can be contacted easily before or after your event. People from these NGOs come and take the leftovers and distribute them carefully amongst the people who need food the most. </p>
